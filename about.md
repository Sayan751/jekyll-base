Hi,

I am Sayan.
By profession I am a software developer.
I enjoy programming, and writing about it (though I have not written much in this blog so far, I used to have an [old blog](http://programersnotebook.blogspot.de/), which I intend to port to this new blog).
However, for day to day activity Stack Overflow and the tons of good articles/blog posts on internet are enough.
So it is pointless to write about the same stuff again, as I am not interested in *inventing my own wheel*.

This blog also serves as my personal quick reference, which means that the posts are more for me, rather than for you.
If you like it then it is a bonus for me. :smile:
I try to write the posts which are understandable for me, and I hope it will also be the same for you.
If you have any feedback, please don't hesitate to leave a comment.

Though I am not sure how frequent I am going to post here, as at present I am in the process of formally learning JavaScript, some of my future posts will be on JavaScript.

Thank you for look around here. 

Hope this helps.
